Just now created this repository to hold all the desired thoughts which i have been cramming up inside my brain, inside tiny words, pictures, document files, pages strewn here and there, thousands of other detrimental moments.

There have been serious changes and events which have passed by me, and somehow i have come out through all of them unscathed, and reborn.
Another similar journey is going on right now, where i am trying to get over the same set of addictions i had an year ago, but with a completely different perspective.

This time, i have the lord with me, and i surrender unto him fully. I want to say that i have still not been able to completely get over the habits of smoking, and that is the only thing which seems like the hurdle i have to get over. But this train of thought is just the train which i am not consciously taking.

things keep happening at the rates, which are too much to put in words. but still one can only try and that does not hurt.

All of a sudden i cannot stop myself from getting off this office chair, and move out drink some tea and smoke a ciggarette. I need to get out of the thought train, and simply be where i am, without the need of consuming anything else, which is supposed to make me feel better.

damn. i find that strangely i am kind of better and yet kind of at the same place, all over the same. These words i see on the screen, simply reminds me of the energy that i am creating from my own thoughts and imagination and being able to see what i am creating , i can only remember that this is not me, but the power of the lord, which enables us to see and imagine and understand.

We only think, we see, but in reality if you can understand, its all just simply illusion, made to work for us in such a way that we keep thinking this is real. We work and run and live and do everything only in the context of this itself, and right now i might simply be trying to put all that i have in my mind. 

confucious, wow, a man who is here looking for answers, and his name is something which reminds people about how confused he really was.

Listening to this art of kirtan video online on youtube, while working and after the work was done, simply reading the past memoir document which i had written earlier. Memoir as i call it, and there i find that i have only been like this since the earliest.

be back.
