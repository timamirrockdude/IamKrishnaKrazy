Just now created this repository to hold all the desired thoughts which i have been cramming up inside my brain, 
inside tiny words, pictures, document files, pages strewn here and there, thousands of other detrimental moments.

There have been serious changes and events which have passed by me, and somehow i have come out through all of them unscathed, and reborn.
Another similar journey is going on right now, where i am trying to get over the same set of addictions 
i had an year ago, but with a completely different perspective.

This time, i have the lord with me, and i surrender unto him fully. I want to say that i have still not been able 
to completely get over the habits of smoking, and that is the only thing which seems like the hurdle i have to get over. 
But this train of thought is just the train which i am not consciously taking.

things keep happening at the rates, which are too much to put in words. but still one can only try and that does not hurt.

All of a sudden i cannot stop myself from getting off this office chair, and move out drink some tea and smoke a ciggarette. 
I need to get out of the thought train, and simply be where i am, without the need of consuming anything else, 
which is supposed to make me feel better.

damn. i find that strangely i am kind of better and yet kind of at the same place, all over the same. 
These words i see on the screen, simply reminds me of the energy that i am creating from my own thoughts and 
imagination and being able to see what i am creating , i can only remember that this is not me, but the power of the lord, 
which enables us to see and imagine and understand.

We only think, we see, but in reality if you can understand, its all just simply illusion,
made to work for us in such a way that we keep thinking this is real. We work and run and live and do everything only
in the context of this itself, and right now i might simply be trying to put all that i have in my mind. 

confucious, wow, a man who is here looking for answers, and his name is something which reminds people about how confused he really was.

Listening to this art of kirtan video online on youtube, while working and after the work was done, 
simply reading the past memoir document which i had written earlier. Memoir as i call it, 
and there i find that i have only been like this since the earliest.

be back.

Last time i made an entry, it was into the raspberry pi which i have kept at home, and that still contains a text file
which has it all. turns out that i havent been able to compile them all together yet and i understand that with time, i will also 
learn this skill. the only condition being that this is to be considered a skill afterall.

something suddenly changed in me since two days back, since it was the day when i broke again and i couldnt control myself. I took the
support of the condemned thing again, and this time, it was my mother who took a step and that step alone made me realize where i was
wrong. I swore an oath that day afterwards on my own life that i will never do it again, and the next one i know is the one which i will 
be taking in some more days to stop this smoking part for ever.

Seems like its not yet time for me to leave the office space, and the level of work which i have got is something which i have always 
been waiting for, and thus i dont have any such regrets now. I also understand that there needs to be proper balance of work and life
and that is something which nobody will ever teach me, except my dear lord in the form of time. today i have been able to reach some
conclusion related to the work which i have been into since the past 7 days, analysis of single object, and it kinda feels wierd to
talk about work again here, since this place is made for that kind of scene, but i am just here to avoid the exact opposite.

something new happened again today, when since this morning i havent been able to feel satisfied with however much songs i listen to,
and most of all the best part is that i have touched the long lost tamil and other south indian songs which i had stopped listening
after the day i did the biggest blunder or maybe the best thing of my life.
